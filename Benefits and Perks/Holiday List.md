Holiday's falling on weekends will be observed on a working weekday and will be highlighted on the gov.uk website.

We also have a mandatory 4 days of Xmas/New year shut down period in December. If there is work to be done and it has been agreed with upper management, the 4 days of mandatory holiday will be voided.
