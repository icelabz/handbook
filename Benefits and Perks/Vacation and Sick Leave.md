Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least two weeks in advance.

# Holidays

## Bank holidays

All employees are paid for statutory holidays in accordance with UK bank holidays. If an employee is required to work on a bank holiday they are entitled to a day off in lieu. Part timers, who do not work on bank holidays and therefore do not benefit from the bank holiday, are entitled to pro-rated additional leave.

## Holiday Year

The holiday year starts from the 1st of March to 28th / 29th of February the following year. 

## Booking holidays

Holiday leave is only to be taken at times agreed between you and your line manager subject to business requirements. The holiday form should be completed and filed by the line manager as a record of all holidays agreed. Holiday should be booked as far in advance as possible, and no later than two weeks before the leave dates. 

## Christmas Period

Employees are required to save 4 days of their 25 days leave for the Christmas period.

## Part Time

If you work on a part-time basis you are entitled to holiday on the same basis as a full-time employee but pro-rated according to your individual hours. Holidays are rounded up to the nearest half day.
* 25 days x Weekly hours worked 40 hours


## Starters and Leavers

Starters and leavers will have holiday pro-rated for the part year worked. For leavers any leave untaken will be paid. Where leave has been taken above the entitlement, the number of days will be deducted from pay.
* (Annual entitlement /12) x (Number completed months worked)

Holidays are rounded up to the nearest half day.


## Carrying over holidays

Up to 5 days of annual leave can be taken over from one holiday year to the next. Payment will not be made in lieu, except in the case of termination of employment.

# Sick Leave
