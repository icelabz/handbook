# Policy Changes

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

## Platforms and Tools

Icelabz will review the master changes from Clef's handbook and see if it fits in our model of work. However, our policies are heavily amended for a business that sits between offline and the online world so a lot of the policies setup by Clef does not apply to our business model.

The policies in this fork will be updated on a regular basis, any changes should be distributed to the employees formally via our internal portal at [https://icelabz.co.uk/forms](https://icelabz.co.uk/forms)

### Github

The handbook is hosted on Github, and anyone with a Github account can make an issue or open a pull request. This is an important home for the project, and we want to encourage and reward participation. We should respond to issues and comments here and use the edits in pull requests when theyâ€™re appropriate. Clef and Icelabz will do this regularly, and anyone else is free to respond when they're interested. This will help more people feel bought into the handbook and will help us gather more opinions on our policies.

## Proposals

Pull requests on Github to change our employee policy will be reviewed, if these are not compliant to our business model they will be disregarded. However, we welcome legislative changes and any help from others to help produce the best employee handbook.

## Adoption

Everyone at Clef needs to sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt for the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt.md), but any change to these documents need to be acknowledged by every employee. Most companies do this on each employee's first day, and then have employees sign another acknowledgement whenever they make a change (because they're rare).

Because we want these policies to constantly improve, we will merge changes as they appear. To make enforcing policy clear and unambiguous, we will adopt the changes at the beginning of each quarter. We will use milestones on Github to mark these canonical versions of the handbook, and we'll host them all at [getclef.com/handbook](https://getclef.com/handbook). They will be labeled with the dates that they applied, so if there is ever a question or complaint about a policy violation, it will be clear which policies applied on which dates at Clef.

Every employee will need to sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt of Changes to the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt%20of%20Changes.md) each quarter, which may not scale as we grow to more employees.
