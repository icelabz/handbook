# Icelabz Core Values

## Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the "best", because "best" means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

## Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and colleagues have different needs from our own, so we must consider their  perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

## Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.

## We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future. 

## Putting life before work

As we live in a fast paced working environment in the UK, the world around us changes so fast and puts a lot of strain on deliverying our service. We give priority to our employees to have a better work life balance. We don't want our employees to feel stressed out, pressured, over worked or fatigued. We want them to enjoy their work in a relaxed, friendly and familial surrounding. We allow for our employees to talk to upper management at anytime to raise any concerns so that any changes in their life is taken into consideration.
